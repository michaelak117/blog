<h2>September 12, 2014:  Do you want to be happier? Smarter?  Better at Sex? </h2>

<p> We live in the modern age.  With that comes a great deal of new challenges that were not faced by even our direct ancestors.  We are exposed to many different things in our environment, our food supply has dramatically changed, and we face a new slew of diseases and health issues. Unfortunately, our society promotes many of the activites that have caused a deterioration and decline in the quality of the human experience. I'd like to offer you a persective that is much different than the one we have grown up on.  It took me a number of years to realize that life should be maximized and by following the herd in America, you are subject to a less optimal life.  Allow me to tell my story.  I will be brief and concise, but ultimately I want to explain to you a new perspective you can take in approaching your lifestyle choices that can lead to more success, happiness, and a longer, fuller life.</p>

<h3> My typical American life Tranformed</h3>
<p> The first quarter century of my life was not one that I would complain about.  I was very blessed to grow up in a middle class household, with entreprenuerial parents.  They owned a small business and my brothers and I grew up working the counter, learning the value of hard work and money.  I worked hard in school as well as learned to be pretty good at sports.  From logging hours of basketball in the driveway and football in the front yard, my brothers in I became standout athletes later in life.
