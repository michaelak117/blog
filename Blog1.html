<h1>  Blog 1: Improving YOU! </h1>

<h2>September 12, 2014:  Do you want to be happier? Smarter?  Better at Sex? </h2>

<p> We live in the modern age.  With that comes a great deal of new challenges that were not faced by even our direct ancestors.  We are exposed to many different things in our environment, our food supply has dramatically changed, and we face a new slew of diseases and health issues. Unfortunately, our society promotes many of the activites that have caused a deterioration and decline in the quality of the human experience. I'd like to offer you a persective that is much different than the one we have grown up on.  It took me a number of years to realize that life should be maximized and by following the herd in America, you are subject to a less optimal life.  Allow me to tell my story.  I will be brief and concise, but ultimately I want to explain to you a new perspective you can take in approaching your lifestyle choices that can lead to more success, happiness, and a longer, fuller life.</p>

<h3> My typical American life Tranformed</h3>
<p> The first quarter century of my life was not one that I would complain about.  I was very blessed to grow up in a middle class household, with entreprenuerial parents.  They owned a small business and my brothers and I grew up working the counter, learning the value of hard work and money.  I worked hard in school as well as learned to be pretty good at sports.  From logging hours of basketball in the driveway and football in the front yard, my brothers in I became standout athletes later in life.  In high school I was revered as a top running back in Texas and I had aspirations to go to college, as instilled in me by my parents.  I went to college and maintained good grades, also maintaining success as a football player.  I had a great relationship, a top notch education, and a load of friends.  
	Boring right?  Not atypical by any means.  The twist here is that for some reason through all of these experiences and positive characteristics, I knew I was not as happy as I should be.  There were subtle things that I experienced that pointed to this.  I wasn't easily satisfied.  Like anyone, I turned to outside stimulants and friends to cover it. The bottom line, I was intelligent, accomplished, and had things going for me, but something was still pulling me down internally, no matter what I did. 
After years of discovery and self education on different health principles, I realized how easy it was to be suppressed in ones health, especially in the modern age.  I as a product of this, as much as anyone over the last 2-3 generations It is a result of the environment we now find out selves in and the nutrition we are putting in our body.  The food supply is a interesting topic, which we can speak about later.  For now, sufficie it to say that Food Science and the Food Industry have ulterior motives to keep us eating chemicals and harmful toxins present in our food supply.  Greed is the reason.  I realized that despite my good fortune and hard work, there were some silent killers taking away from my life being as good as it could be.  My brain began to decline, as did my energy.  I became depressed and had subtle health issues that would arise.  Do you ever get a intermittent headache or stomach ache and think to yourself that its normal.  Trust me, it is not! How about constantly feeling tired, having gas, or other subtle symptoms on your skin i.e. acne and rashes. These are all signs that something is off kilter in your body.

<h4> What to pay attention to....</h4>
These are all subtle signs of what living in an unhealthy environment can bring, but I realize these sound minimal.  The problem is they often cascade into serious health issues through time.  Constant bombardment of environmental toxins and food based toxins beging to break down our systems starting in our gut. The gut is a part of out body that houses most of hormones, our immune system, and of course the place where energy is converted from foods we eat.  If we are not careful in taking care of our gut, we see inflammation arise.  I will talk more about many of these subjects later, but understand that inflammation is the biggest contributor to major modern chronic diseases, such as diabetes, heart disease, brain disease, depression, autism, and many more.  Its not the same inflammation that swells when we twist an ankle, but a silent inflammation that happens in our bodies and damages our organs. Part of what makes us have random stomach aches, headaches, depression, or lethargy is at the source of inflammation.  Inflammatory foods, such as GMOs, Gluten, Dairy, Soy, Sugar, alchohol and many others can wreak havoc on our guts (the nucleus of our bodies health).  Environmental toxins like mold, mercury toxicity, chemical intolerance, and others also contribute.  Once we have compromised our bodies defense and energy conversion source (gut), we develop diseases like diabetes (mostly a result of the Standard American Diet i.e. carbs/sugar).

<p> This is simply an introduction to the growing movement of health transformations. There are two pieces.  The first is how we choose to live our lives on a daily basis.  Second, it is the dynamic of our healthcare system.  The first is obvious, and my goal is to bring to light why you should <span> eat a clean diet</span>.  The second is one that diserves its own blog post, but lets start by understanding the concept of conventional vs functional medicine.  The former, conventional medicine, is what we all know and are used to.  This came about as the disovery of penicillin, antibiotics and other helpful bacterias and their ability to fight infectious diseases.  The general priciple is when you have an issue, like a headache, and stomach ache, or whatever, we go see our general practitioner and they will give us a pill to combat it.  Inately we know that popping pills isn't good for us, but the other problem is that addressing one <strong> symptom </strong> of a problem never really addresses the core issue.  Its a "pill for an ill" approach and it only masks a <strong>symptom</strong>.</p>
	<p> There is a better way. It is a new wave of modern medicine known as <span>Functional Medicine</span>. It focuss on the core of health issues of symptoms in our body.  It realizes that the body is a whole and no part can be fixed unless the entire system is addresses. This quote from plato is timeless and is at the core of <span>Functional Medicine</span>. <img src="images/plato.png"/> When you look at issues in your body, only addressing one issue is counterproductive to the nature and complexity of the human body system.  Everything works together.  By covering something up, you either compromise other areas of your body, that will break down over time.  For example, hormone therapy for thyroid issues eventually results in imbalances of other hormones like estrogen.  This leads to changing pills or taking more in the conventional medicine world. However, by focuses on the core of that issue, you can resolve it at its source and move on with life.  In fact, many times you are able to resolve issues you didn't know existed beyond that one initial symptom and reep benefits you wouldn't have imagined....like better sex, energy, and mental clarity. If you have health issues or symptoms, how about considering a better approach, a functional one!  Doesn't it just make sense to combat something at its core?  As I will later share with you in depth, the gut is the core area where most issues begin and cascade to other issues, so we will talk a lot about maintaining a healthy gut with nutrition.  And of course, how that can also make you smarter, healthier, and sexier!  </p>
